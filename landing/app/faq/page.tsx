    question: "2. How does EquipmentGram work?",
    answer: (
      <div>
        When a customer wants construction or heavy equipment inspected, they would go onto the EquipmentGram website
        where they would sign up for an EquipmentGram account for free and would then fill out an inspection request
        form. On the form, they would provide information such as where the inspection would take place, the time when
        it would take place, and the kind of equipment that would be inspected. <br /> With that information received,
        EquipmentGram would dispatch an inspector at the time and place requested. <br /> Once the inspection is
        finished, the full inspection report will be available to customers on their dashboard account. From their
        account, they can carry out activities like sending out their reports, etc and would have a full log of all
        reports they ever requested for.
